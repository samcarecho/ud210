/*Find the min and max and average of 15 numbers that a user will input.
 **The numbers range from 0 to 100.
 **We will do it now for practice and again later when we learn arrays and
 **functions. So you do not have to keep all fifteen numbers stored in memory.
 **HINT: you will need to use scanf for input text.
