/*Goal: practice searching an array in C++
 **There is an array of integers. The length of the arrays to be searched
 **varies. A user will enter an integer and the program will search the array.
 **If the value is in the array, the program will return the location of
 **the element. If the value is not in the array, the user will be notified
 **that the value is not in the array. To exit the program the user will enter -1.
